# Seven Segment Display Project

#### Project Overview
The Seven Segment Display project demonstrates how to interface a common cathode 7-segment display with an Arduino Mega to display numbers from 0 to 9 sequentially. Seven segment displays are widely used for numerical output in digital clocks, timers, counters, and more.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **Common Cathode 7-Segment Display**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram
*Insert block diagram here*

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the 7-Segment Display to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Segments (a-g, and dot):** Connected to digital pins 2 to 9 on the Arduino Mega.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - The display will cycle through numbers 0 to 9, displaying each for 1 second.
   - Verify that each segment lights up correctly to form the digits.

#### Applications
- **Digital Counters:** Display count values.
- **Timer Displays:** Indicate elapsed time.
- **Scoreboards:** Show scores or game information.

#### Notes
- **Digit Patterns:** Each number 0-9 is represented by a specific pattern of illuminated segments.
- **Looping Display:** The loop function continuously cycles through the numbers.
